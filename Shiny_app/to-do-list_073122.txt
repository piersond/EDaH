- Use global.R to help make app easier to reuse
- Split up code into test apps for each tab (map, plot, sensor, database)
  - Use the same global.R to feed the tab-apps

- Add site shapefiles to map
  - Eventually add points for all data with GPS locations (overlapping?)

- Make sensor data work for each site
  - Pull sensor data from GDrive (use local if fail)
  - Sensors need names --> make a lookup tbl
